nycopencv
===========

You should keep your source at 
```
/opt/nycopencv/nycopencv
```

It's a good practice to keep the build separate, so to build the package make a separate directory;

```
/opt/nycopencv/build
```

You can build the package  by `cd`-ing to there running

```
cmake /opt/nycopencv/nycopencv; make
```
